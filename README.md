# Team Collaboration #1

**The purpose of this project is to leverage GitHub platform and Git to host our repo and manage our codebase**

Team,

GitHub provides a centraliced location for hosting and managing our project using the Git version control system.
The first step to getting this party started is to clone this repository, which means creating a **local copy** of this **remote repository**
Cloning this repo will allow you to make changes to the files, commit those changes, and push those commits back to the remote repository.

- open your terminal
- run the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/LuceroSDJ/vanilla-JS-team-collaboration.git`

Once you run this command in your terminal, Git will create a new directory with the name of the repository in your current directory and download all of the files from the remote repository to your local machine.
